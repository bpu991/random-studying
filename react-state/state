- In any sufficiently advanced web app, the user interface has to be stateful
- logged-in users see a different screen than logged out users
- clicked 'edit-profile' opens up a modal window
- sections of a website can expand or collapse
- State is designed to change in response to events
- What does state track?
    - UI Logic: changing the state of the interface
    - Business logic: the changing state of data (ie. messages that are read/unread)
    - Before state, people would change state by selecting DOM elements

Core React Concept Review
    - Component
        - building block of React
        - combines logic (js) with presentation (jsx)
    - Prop
        - data passed to a component 
        - immutable; component cannot change its own props
    - State
        - internal data specific to a component

What is React State?
    - State is an instance attribute on a component
    - It's always an object (POJO), since you'll want to keep track of several
      keys/values

Initial State
    - State should be initialized as soon as the component is created
    - Set it in the constructor function
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
                /* values to track */
            }
        }

Changing State
    - this.setState() is the built in React method of changing component's state
    - Can call in any instance method except constructor
    - Takes an object describing the state changes
    - Patches state object - keys that you didn't specify dont change
    - Asynchronous
